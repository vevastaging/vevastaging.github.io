The information contained in communications from VEVA is qualified by and subject to more detailed information contained in additional materials. Before making any investment, please 1) consult qualified and appropriate financial, tax, investment, and legal advisors; 2) perform independent research, investigation, and analysis; 3) factor in all appropriate risks/uncertainties, charges, and other expenses, including but not limited to opportunity costs; and 4) recognize that investing is an inherently uncertain activity that should only be taken on by qualified investors who are willing and able to accept the risks. VEVA makes no representation or guarantee as to the legality of any investment discussed.

        This material has been compiled for informational purposes only. No communication by VEVA, Inc. or any of its affiliates (collectively, “VEVA™”) should be construed or is intended to be investment, financial, accounting, tax, legal, regulatory or compliance advice, nor is it intended to be a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any security or interest in VEVA or any other entity.  Nothing in this communication is intended to be an offer to extend credit, an offer to purchase or sell securities or a solicitation of any securities transaction. No deal of any kind will be implied by VEVA without the exchange of appropriate notice and paperwork.

        Past performance and/or projections are no guarantee of future results. Any mention of expected or historical returns, or financial projections may not reflect actual future performance. Estimates and projections, such as the ones that may be contained in this communication, do not represent or guarantee that any transaction will (or is likely to) achieve similar results or profits. All investments involve risk and may result in significant losses, up to and including the loss of all or substantially all of one’s principle. Our information is intended for qualified investors only, who are willing and able to take on the risks and responsibilities of investing. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of loss of capital, credit risk, and/or interest rate risk. Private placement investments involve a high degree of risk and are completely speculative in nature. Many of the investments communicated by VEVA are private-placement investments that require long-term commitments and may be subject to holding period requirements and the associated illiquidity. Individuals who can not hold for the specified period, who may have liquidity concerns, or who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest.
        <b>We recommend ensuring that you can afford the loss of your entire capital before making any investment.</b>

        This communication contains initial reference material and  is intended for informational purposes only, and is not meant to be a complete overview of all applicable data. Communications from VEVA may employ the use of “forward-looking” statements (which often include, but are not limited to using, such words as ‘expect’, ‘anticipate’, ‘project’, ‘believe’, ‘may’, ‘might’, ‘should’, or ‘believe’, as well as any negations or comparable language). Due to the uncertain nature of investing and the risks involved, actual performance may differ substantially from what is contemplated in these (or similar) “forward-looking” statements, which are entirely hypothetical and represent estimated predictions. VEVA can not and does not guarantee future results. Hypothetical performance models are shown before applicable taxes, fees, and/or other expenses that may be incurred as part of the investment process.

No metrics, calculations, financial models, or other statements have been audited or independently verified for accuracy or completeness by any authority (regulatory or otherwise) and may differ from reality due to the uncertain nature of investing. Additionally, VEVA may link to or reproduce third-party content. Such linking or reproduction does not constitute an endorsement or approval of the content. Neither do we  approve of or endorse any third-party writings concerning VEVA or any affiliates.

Communications from VEVA involve investments that are not recommended or approved by any federal or state regulatory authority (including but not limited to the SEC), or insured by the FDIC or any other agency or party (including but not limited to VEVA). Portfolios should be balanced, and alternative investments should only constitute part of your overall portfolio. Investment decisions should be based on a wide variety of factors rather than any one metric. Such factors include but are not limited to individual risk tolerance, liquidity concerns, legality, investment experience, current financial position, and other key considerations.
